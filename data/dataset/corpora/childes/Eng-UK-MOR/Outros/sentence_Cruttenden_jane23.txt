it's a nice day round the corner 
the tea's ready you've got_to sit up 
I blowed my kite 
I going to drink it now 
that mine 
I sitting on here 
I very hot 
I got a school bag 
I'll tidy it 
when I get up I can have make on 
I like the swings the roundabout and the seesaw 
she might be not coming 
oo it dropped the lid 
they had girls on 
don't forget teddy 
I'll choose them to everybody 
I didn't do it 
you play it with me 
the wind come out hasn't it 
keep it to not fall any further 
I want Mac to bring me
