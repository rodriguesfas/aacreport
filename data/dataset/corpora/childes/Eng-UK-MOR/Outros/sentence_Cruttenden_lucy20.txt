I can't undone it 
thought thought thought thought thought 
because because because because because because because 
let me sit on there 
one going and one coming out 
just a little bit open 
I a big girl to wink now 
thought thought thought thought thought thought 
you send her back home 
I didn't have enough this time 
drank drank drank drank drank drank 
there was a fly coming in my forehead 
look at he's on your shirt 
he was a fly coming in here 
he's going up your shirt Charlie 
he's gone now 
shoo him now 
this afternoon feels going 
let me take this down please 
there's a fly just on the curtain 
lost lost lost lost lost lost lost lost 
Grandad give me this 
I got a hat on it wont rain on me 
I going to have a purple Jimbo car
