come back in a minute 
there's a little Wendy house 
got all now

like bones 
like cake 
like jam tarts 
Andrew's a big boy 
in my tummy 
Daddy's down the room 
like chocolate biscui 
pick all up

mine's got loads 
another one's down the floor 
got sticky hand

like a bit of lunch Dad

mine's a silly throwing down 
that's all clean 
spilled a little bit here 
an ice cream man

and up again 
like it on a plate 
go in the Wendy house 
down there

like a cup of tea Daddy 
it's a heavy one 
when mine get off 
it's a bit hot

see Daddy's tummy 
in tomorrow 
what Daddy's tired for 
it's all out 
what are those called over there 
and in mine 
and again and again and again 
go away down the room 
by bus 
like to go on the train 
one over there going to come little one 
that little one 
and a little one 
going in a caravan another one long times 
those are big ones on the light 
flies don't come 
like some apple 
where's Mummy's rockery gone 
there Mummy's rockery outside
