cut the orange up 
what have you done that for 
the smoke's coming out isn't it 
it might be not muddy where those steps are 
then we found the Mini 
then we was getting in it 
then we was going 
please may I have a straw 
do you need the scissors 
Jenny can get one and I can get the other 
I thought I was hearing you 
can it not work
