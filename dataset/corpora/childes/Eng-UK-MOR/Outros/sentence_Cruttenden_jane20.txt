Sally isn't wakened up 
saw saw saw saw 
he went 
I ironing this 
you can't have this one 
I'll tell him to not 
I did blowed it 
Nicky playing 
take these off 
I ready to park the car 
what's you doing 
where we go 
I play play post it 
hospital 
you give me a kiss before you go 
I did forget 
now we can go out 
you take this for me 
I want some eggie tonight 
anybody didn't do it 
I didn't do something 
you've got some big glasses well as small ones 
we take a caravan behind me 
we can take people a ride 
you buy me a motor bike one day 
I want something more to eat 
I going to have a big pram like Lisa's pram 
thought thought thought thought thought
