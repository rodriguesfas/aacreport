it burning 
he's forgotten it 
anybody's not doing it 
like that little blob what's on the plate 
I not called Jenny are I 
I didn't know what day the string came off didn't you 
how many were the crisps 
I did taught it on my own 
tell Daddy not to switch the landing light off every time he comes up 
I'm looking for it 
you can't have them till I here 
didn't didn't didn't didn't didn't didn't didn't didn't 
will you not do that again 
anybody wasn't at the door 
those are his wings he flies
